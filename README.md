# hello-world
This my first repository, just keep going.

I am a senior software engineer in communication field. My daily job is reading some routing protocols， designing software architecture， and solve hard problem while coding, debugging, testing and so on.

But after live in communication field so many years, I find it just soso, and donot have more things to attract me as before. I start to find something new which can light my passion. As bigdata and AI technique is popular now and for keep learning and growing， I make my GitHub.

Good luck!
